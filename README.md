The commitment of this repository is to allow all the Developer Student Clubs to **generate a site** for their club in **less than 3 minutes**, performing a few simple steps.<br> <br>
**The management of this site does not require any kind of web development and backend competence.**

## How can I change the content of the site without knowing web languages?

To change the content of the site, go to the `content` folder located in the root of the project. In this folder there are several .yaml files in which you can modify the contents. 

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To install you first need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.
You need to perform the following steps only the first time.
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Developer-Student-Club-UoA/website/
cd website

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Run on localhost:8000 (by default)
# and edit the /content folder
npm run develop
```

**that's it!**

## Deploy on Github Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```
